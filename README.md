This work was performed over the summer with the goal of automating the calculation of key performance indicators for NCAA pitchers.

The KPI Automator file shows the script I used to calculate key performance indicators for pitchers across 2024 collegiate baseball data, a data set containing over a million observations. This code contains data cleaning and manipulation for large-scale data. A particularly difficult section was tracking "Freebies" and "Outs After Freebies", which track a team's mistakes and how well pitchers respond to them.
